# Abalone Regression

This repository contains code and resources for the Abalone Regression competition on Kaggle.

## Overview

The goal of this competition is to predict the age of abalone from physical measurements. The dataset contains various features such as length, diameter, height, whole weight, shucked weight, viscera weight, shell weight, and rings.

## Dataset

The dataset can be downloaded from the [Kaggle competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/abalone-regression/data). It consists of the following files:
- `train.csv`: Training data
- `test.csv`: Test data
- `sample_submission.csv`: Sample submission file
